# -Zero-Shot-Learning-Text-Classifier

I have created a zero-shot learning text classifier using Hugging Face's API inference and Distilbart!

With it you will have the mighty power to classify keyphrases on-the-fly, fast, and without any ML training!


<ul> You can set these labels dynamically to anything, e.g.:
  <li>'Positive', 'Negative' and 'Neutral' for sentiment analysis</li>
  <li>'Angry', 'Happy', 'Emotional' for emotion analysis</li>
  <li>'Navigational', 'Transactional', 'Informational' for intent classification purposes</li>
  <li>Your product range  (bags, shoes, boots etc.)</li>
</ul>
